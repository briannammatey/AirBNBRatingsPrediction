# BTTAIFinalProject
 This project is a Machine Learning project predicting the reviews from guests based on airbnb features 

## Objectives
- Frame the review score prediction as a supervised regression problem.

- Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.

- Explore the data for patterns, trends, and outliers.

- Train multiple models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest.

- Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (RMSE, RÂ²).

 - Prevent overfitting and ensure generalization to new data.
